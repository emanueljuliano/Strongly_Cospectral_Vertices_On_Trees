# Strongly Cospectral Vertices On Trees

This repository contains the data and the analysis of my research on Algebraic Graph Theory


## Notebooks

- `Strongly_Cospectral_Vertices.ipynb` contains the code that I use when start searching for the trees with more than 2 strongly cospectral vertices

- `Non_isomorphic_trees.ipynb` contains some experiments about trees such that a and b are strongly cospectral but T\a isn't isomorphic to T\b

- `Idempotents_with_matching_polynomial.ipynb` here I try to recreate the idea of Idempotents using the matching polynomial of a graph


## Folder structure

- `./script/` contains the script to process several trees and verify it's properties

- `./data/` data generated by the scripts

Auxiliar folders:

- `./tests/` contains some tests, not necessarily related to cospectrality
